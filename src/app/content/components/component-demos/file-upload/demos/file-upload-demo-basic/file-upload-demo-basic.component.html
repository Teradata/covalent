<h4>Team Notice:</h4>
<p>
  The Covalent team built this component 4 years ago following an example in the wild, but it never followed the proper Material Design spec nor guidelines.
</p>

<p>
  We are removing it in the next major release and are suggesting people to migrate into our <strong>file-input</strong> implementation.
