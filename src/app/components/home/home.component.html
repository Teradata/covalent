      <td-expansion-panel label="What is the Covalent?" sublabel="what is this thing?">
        <div class="md-padding">
          Covalent is a UI Platform that combines design language and a web framework, built on Angular 2.0 & Angular-Material (Design).
          It will give you a quickstart to build a modern web application UI and ensure consistency across Teradata products.
          Some of the most important features:
          <ul>
            <li>Angular-Material 2.0</li>
            <li>Angular 2.0 Command-line interface (CLI) for builds, deploys, testing & more</li>
            <li>Drastically simplified interface layouts (for dashboards, lists, etc)</li>
            <li>Custom web components (stepper, file upload, expansion panels & more)</li>
            <li>750+ Material Design icons</li>
            <li>Style Guide with brand standards, color palettes & tips</li>
            <li>Design Patterns for consistent, reusable web components such as cards, forms, etc</li>
            <li>Testing Tools for unit tests and end-to-end tests</li>
            <li>Quickstart app to get started right away!</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </td-expansion-panel>
      <td-expansion-panel label="Why Covalent?" sublabel="what's up with that name?">
        <div class="md-padding">
          We follow the Atomic Design principles, applying them to Angular-Material web components. In Atomic Design, several atoms (such as buttons and inputs) form molecules (such as a search box).
          Our covalent bonds are these molecules we're building on top of Angular-Material. Also, covalent bonds are liquid and conform to their container, just like our responsive layouts!
        </div>
      </td-expansion-panel>
      <td-expansion-panel label="Why would I use this?" sublabel="can't I just build my own?">
        <div class="md-padding">
          By using a unified UI Platform there are a ton of benefits. Here are some highlights:
          <ul>
            <li>Angular-Material v2 doesn't have a full app quickstart</li>
            <li>Angular-Material v2 doesn't have the flexbox layout from v1</li>
            <li>We provide several custom components such as stepper & expansion panels</li>
            <li>These layouts & components are being develop for enterprise solutions</li>
            <li>You get a selection for UI layouts out the box</li>
            <li>We will continuously add tools like Syntax Highlighting & Markdown</li>
            <li>We will always maintain native compatibility with Angular 2 & Material 2</li>
            <li>We will always follow the principles of the official Material Design spec</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </td-expansion-panel>
      <td-expansion-panel label="Why Material Design?" sublabel="what's so great about Material?">
        <div class="md-padding">
          By adopting Material Design along with Angular, we get a style guide spec perfectly matched with an incredbly powerful and modern web framework, all for free.
          Along with that, there are lots of other great benefits such as:
          <ul>
            <li>It’s a design spec married to code implementation</li>
            <li>Official implementations from the the designer/developer (Google)</li>
            <li>The spec keeps growing & iterating for you w/o your time</li>
            <li>So many devices & breakpoints have been considered</li>
            <li>Familiarity for Users, Designers & Developers</li>
            <li>Focused on Accessibility (out the box)</li>
            <li>Design & Code are open sourced for you</li>
            <li>It's a natural bridge to agile development</li>
            <li>Inspiration, Community & Resources from around the world</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </td-expansion-panel>
      <td-expansion-panel label="But won't we look like Google?" sublabel="great question, you're not alone in that concern">
        <div class="md-padding">
          With any new framework people's intial reaction is that they'll lose their company brand or identity.
          Consider when 960 grids came out, or Bootstrap from Twitter. Many said "All sites will look the same!".
          They weren't completely wrong for a time when adoption began, but with time, usage & innovation, your uniqueness always shines through!
          Also consider:
          <ul>
            <li>Material Design is being embraced across the web and not specific to Google anymore</li>
            <li>Think of Material Design as a native Web SDK. Just as you would if you developed an OSX or iOS app.</li>
            <li>It's a good thing for onboarding users if the patterns are familiar.</li>
            <li>Think of your favorite iOS, Android or Windows app that aheres to the OS's design. Aren’t the features more important? What really is the “brand”?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </td-expansion-panel>
      <td-expansion-panel label="Why Angular 2.0?" sublabel="why not React/Ember/Java/etc?">
        <div class="md-padding">
          <p>The short answer: we have to pick something & Angular has won the adoption war.</p>
          The longer answer:
          Before passing judgement if you have Angular 1.x experience, remember 2.0 is a complete rewrite & very different.
          Angular 2.0 moved from an opinionate framework to a sophistated platform. What's that mean?
          With ES2015 (previously ES6) and the power of Typescript, Angular 2.0 is a much more native JavaScript platform with coding paradigmns & power previously reserved for backend languages.
          This means many more Teradata employees can jump into the frontend and ramp up to productivity.
          Also there's tons of other benefits like:
          <ul>
            <li>New & exciting software to learn & advocate</li>
            <li>More easily attract new hires</li>
            <li>An incredibly powerful standardized CLI we don't have to build</li>
            <li>More powerful IDEs for development</li>
            <li>Integrated testing tools</li>
            <li>Native mobile & desktop app support</li>
          </ul>

          We give you everything you need to quickly get started on your UI, but you have the domain knowledge and are the expert in your product.

          Don't worry though, we have detailed docs & tips, and there's a wealth of help on the internet (it's why we chose such a popular platform).

            The UX team is extremely lean & agile (notice agile is lower case). We have a simple list of milestones and issues prioritized by demand across products.
            Some big ticket items are underway such as TD Charts, an extensive & standardized component built on Google Charts (continuing w/ the Google web stack).
            We're also building Dynamic Forms which will allow products to build complex forms with a simple key:value pair JSON structure.
            Remember, we're agile so our roadmap is iterative & bite sized for frequent, rapid releases.
