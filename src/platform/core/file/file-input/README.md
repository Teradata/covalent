## TdFileDropDirective: tdFileDrop

## Usage

Add the directive wherever you want to add drop support to an element to bind a [File | FileList] into a class model.

To add effect when <code>ondragenter</code> event is executed, override <code>.drop-zone</code> class in the context you are using it.

Note: if element has child elements, add <code>* { pointer-events: none; }</code> to avoid event being thrown again while navigating in child elements.

Example for usage:

```html
<div tdFileDrop (fileDrop)="files = $event" multiple [disabled]="disabled">
</div> 
```

| Name | Type | Description |

| multiple | boolean | Sets whether multiple files can be dropped at once in host element, or just a single file. Can also be "multiple" native attribute.
| disabled | boolean | Disabled drop events for host element.
| fileDrop | function($event) | Event emitted when a file or files are dropped in host element after being validated. Emits a [FileList or File] object.
