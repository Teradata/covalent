<h4>Team Notice:</h4>
<p>
  The Covalent team built this component 4 years ago following an example in the wild, but it never followed the proper
  Material Design spec nor guidelines.
</p>

<p>
  We are removing it in the next major release and are suggesting people to migrate into our
  <strong>file-input</strong>
  implementation.
