# Covalent Design System

We're merging the Teradata Design System and Covalent into a single 
comprehensive product. In the short term, just use the nav to browse
the raw components. We'll layer in documenation over time.

Ping us in the **#design-system** channel on Slack for help.

      to view those items.
