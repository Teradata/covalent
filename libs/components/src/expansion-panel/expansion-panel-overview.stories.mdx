# Expansion panel

## Anatomy

Set of expandable panels stacked up similar to data table.

#### Interactions and behavior

- Click on the expandable panel anywhere to get the extra information.
- Unexpanded items group into single cards, one before and one after the open panel.
- The expanded panel separates into its own card. Only one panel may be open at a time.

<Canvas>
  <form>
    <expansion-panel>
      <expansion-panel-item></expansion-panel-item>
    </expansion-panel>
  </form>
</Canvas>

## Common mistakes

#### Call to action placement on expanded panel

Do not add any call to action (button/link) on the expansion panel header because
the expansion panel header is clickable and when clicked on expanded state, it
collapses the panel. If absolutely needed, the call to actions can be added at
the bottom of expanded region.

<Canvas>
  <form>
    <expansion-panel>
      <expansion-panel-item></expansion-panel-item>
    </expansion-panel>
    <expansion-panel>
      <expansion-panel-item></expansion-panel-item>
    </expansion-panel>
  </form>
</Canvas>
