# Releases

The release process is fully automated using Semantic Release, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow. Versions are automatically determined based on the commit history of the new set of changes, allowing for precise and consistent versioning. Each release is tagged and branched using the structure "release/x.x.x", providing clear and organized version tracking. This automation not only saves time but also reduces the potential for human error, making the release process more reliable and streamlined. 

## Beta releases
we support beta releases by pushing code to the "beta" branch, allowing for pre-release testing and feedback before the final version is deployed.

**Note:** Only publish to beta branch with the latest changes from the main branch.
